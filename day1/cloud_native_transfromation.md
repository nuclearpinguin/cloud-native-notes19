_Cloud Native_

_Pini Reznik_

Cloud Native transformation requires changes in many fields including management, skills and technology. The transformation should be gradual:
- start with small RD team (5%)
- prepare architecture, processes and onboarding process
- make some PoC
- start gradual transition

#### QA
**Should a company hire a KN consultant?** If she/he is going to help the company to understand the process and technologies it's a good idea. If the person will do everything for the company - no. He should give a rod, not a fish.
