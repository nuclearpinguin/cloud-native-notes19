## Cloud Native - effective computing at scale

Google always build something in an other way than others. This software engineer perspective. 
What is cloud? Storage, network and some vms that's how I saw cloud at the beginning.
What is cloud native? That means that from the beginning we prepare for running out apps and everything on a cloud.

#### History sketch: 
Google was a startup and built the infrastructure by bundling some PCs and running free. It was not the most reliable infrastructure. However, with a time they started using distributed computing. They accepted that failure is a norm and sometimes something must be built from scratch. That's what Google did:

- The Google File System ( Leung, Sanjay)
- MapReduce: Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters (Dean)
- Bigtabe: A distributed storage system for structured data
- Large-scale cluster management at Google with Borg (managing and pulling machines, there is boglets and bogmaster)
- Some author of the paper are now working on Kubernetes. 

In 2001 the distributed computing was a design choice, today in 2019 it's necessity for Google and for many other companies.

#### Cloud natives benefits: 
- scalability
- high availability (HA)
- velocity
- cost efficiency 

Why velocity? In 2003 the average age of a company joining S&P500 was 25 year, in 2013 it was only 10 year. That shows how fast companies are maturing now.


#### Cloud native design principles:
- use redundancy - to achieve scalability and HA (replicate distributed service, prefer stateless, master election, paxos)
    - if dev understands paxos algorithm that means he knows something on distributed systems
    - failure domains in k8s: container (restarted by kubelet), node (rescheduled by node), availability zone (clusters across availability zones))
    - Warsaw team built the replication mechanism for cluster (?)
    - Beyond kubernetes: canarying, avoid cascading failures, 
- use distributed storage - storage is hard (prefere managed solutions), There is no silver bullet => read CAP Theorem !
    - You cannot optimise from all C, A , P. Spanner seems to be optimize from CAP
- use containers- to achieve velocity, ha, cost efficiency (packaging with deps, versioning, isolation, faster deployment)
    - CERN was able to use containers to pack higgs computation in container and move it to k8s.
- microservices - efficient autoscaling, fast, automated CI/CD
- introduce SRE culture (very important):
    - automate everything
    - measure everything
    - blameless postmortems
    - gradual, frequent change

SRE means there's proper monitoring, canarying process, and itâ€™s super important to be blameless in case of fuckups. In such situations learn and improve, that will help the whole company.

#### Transformational ideas:
- distributed computing, redundancy
- containers
- orchestration: kubernetes
- service management
- SRE culture

#### QA
**What about security?** It's very important but that was not the focus of talk.

**What about multi-tenancy apps?** Hot topic in kubernetes world. Kubernetes was not very well designed for that. GKE introduced advanced metering for cost attribution. Mostly people choose instance per service to obtain multi tenancy.

**What about different implementations on k8s?** There are conformant test to check (developed in community) if the implementations are proper.

**What are google working on istio?** I am not sure if I can talk about that.
